| Books | Author | Review |
|:------|:-------|:-------|
| [Isla and the Happily Ever After](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9627755-isla-and-the-happily-ever-after) |  Stephanie Perkins | It's a classic chick lit novel, the kind I use to read in high school but it was good. It was a good page turner and I got through it quickly, on a train and a plane. |
| [David and Goliath](http://gladwell.com/david-and-goliath/) | Malcolm Gladwell | A new book by one of my favorite authors. This was an excellent read. It's another one of those books that weaves together stories you don't hear about into patterns that don't seem intuitive until they are. It's cleverly woven together, backed by math and logic. I love these books. Also checkout his [other books](http://gladwell.com/). |  
| [Think Like A Freak](http://freakonomics.com/2014/04/02/think-like-a-freak-our-new-book-out-on-may-13/) | Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner | Basically same review as above. I wish I could find more books like these. These are my favorite kind of books. Also checkout the [first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freakonomics) and the [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperFreakonomics) in the trilogy. I'm sad they won't be writing anymore of these.|
| [Essentialism](http://www.npr.org/2014/07/26/334038029/lessons-in-essentialism-getting-more-out-of-life-by-doing-less) | | I've been getting into this trend recently. Reading a lot of articles online during my lunch break. It's a good read and it was fun to indulge myself before I go back to school where it's less like essentialism and more like "do everything ism". Ah, college.  |
| [Shopaholic to the Stars](http://www.sophiekinsella.co.uk/book_detail.php?b=7) | Sophia Kinsella | I really only read this because I've read the previous god knows how many books (7th!!) in this series. It's sort of trashy and sort of cheap, but it's a very quick read.|
| [The Ghost Map](http://www.theghostmap.com/) | Steven Johnson | I love this story. I did a presentation on the development of the sewage system in London and the 1848 Cholera outbreak. It was an indepth look at all aspects of the disease from more angles than I thought possible. **Definitely** worth it. It was so great. |
| [We Were Liars](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16143347-we-were-liars) | E. Lockhart | It was a good read. A page turner, and a good book that was aimed at my demographic, for once. It was half a teen romance and half a teen family drama. The mystery in the pages really help keep it going. I got through this book on a train and a plane. It's definitely a enthralling read.  However, retrospectively, I guess I have to agree with the [New York Times Review](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/books/review/we-were-liars-by-e-lockhart.html?_r=0).|
| [Getting Things Done](http://gettingthingsdone.com/) | David Allen | I think I've read this before. It's good, and I like organizational books, but the system is a bit complex and I think it would work better with a consistent work schedule rather than a busy and every shifting school schedule. People say to treat your job like a 9-5 but my job is more like a 10am-12am. Or something like that. |
